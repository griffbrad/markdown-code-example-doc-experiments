Currently, the codetabs syntax used to render code examples in multiple 
ECMAScript dialects in the Gutenberg Handbook looks bad when rendered 
with on Github or NPMJS.org.

This repo has some experiments with alternative approaches that will
hopefully render more pleasantly on those sites as well as providing 
the desired experience on WordPress.org.
